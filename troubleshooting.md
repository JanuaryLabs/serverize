# Troubleshooting Guide

## Introduction

This guide aims to help you resolve common issues you might encounter while using Serverize. We'll cover problems related to deployment, Docker, and CLI usage, and provide step-by-step solutions. We'll also explain how to use the logging feature for effective debugging.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Docker-related Issues

#### Docker is not running

**Symptom:** You receive an error message indicating that Docker is not running when trying to use Serverize.

**Solution:**
1. Check if Docker is installed on your system.
2. Ensure that the Docker daemon is running.
3. If Docker is not running, start it manually or configure it to start automatically on system boot.

#### Container fails to build

**Symptom:** The Docker container fails to build during the deployment process.

**Solution:**
1. Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors.
2. Ensure all required files are present in the build context.
3. Review the build logs for specific error messages.
4. Try building the Docker image manually to isolate the issue:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

### 2. Deployment Issues

#### Project fails to deploy

**Symptom:** Your project fails to deploy using the Serverize CLI.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that your `serverize.config.js` file is correctly configured.
2. Ensure that all required environment variables are set.
3. Check the deployment logs for specific error messages.
4. Try deploying with verbose logging:

```bash
serverize deploy --verbose
```

#### Unable to access deployed application

**Symptom:** The application deploys successfully, but you can't access it via the provided URL.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the correct port is exposed in your Dockerfile and `serverize.config.js`.
2. Check if the application is listening on the correct port inside the container.
3. Ensure that any required environment variables are properly set during deployment.
4. Review the application logs for any startup errors.

### 3. CLI Usage Issues

#### Command not found

**Symptom:** The `serverize` command is not recognized by your terminal.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure that Serverize is installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g serverize
```

2. Verify that the installation directory is in your system's PATH.
3. Try restarting your terminal or command prompt.

#### Incorrect command usage

**Symptom:** You receive an error message indicating incorrect command usage.

**Solution:**
1. Review the command syntax in the Serverize documentation.
2. Use the `--help` flag to see the correct usage for a specific command:

```bash
serverize <command> --help
```

## Using Logs for Debugging

Serverize provides a powerful logging feature that can help you identify and resolve issues. Here's how to use it effectively:

### Accessing Logs

To view logs for a specific project and release:

```bash
serverize logs --project <projectName> --release <releaseName>
```

You can also specify a channel:

```bash
serverize logs --project <projectName> --release <releaseName> --channel <channelName>
```

### Interpreting Logs

The logs are streamed in real-time and can provide valuable information about your application's behavior. Pay attention to:

- Error messages and stack traces
- Warnings and deprecation notices
- Application startup information
- Request and response details

### Tips for Effective Log Analysis

1. Use grep or other text processing tools to filter logs for specific keywords.
2. Look for patterns or recurring issues in the logs.
3. Correlate log entries with the timing of observed issues.
4. Increase log verbosity in your application for more detailed debugging information.
