# Motivation

I remember the times when development felt like it was constantly stopping. Whether I was working on the UI or building the API, waiting for deployments always seemed to break the flow—not just for me, but for the entire team.

That’s why **Serverize**. It’s not just about cutting out the waiting—it’s about keeping **development continuous**. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new endpoint, or trying out new ideas, Serverize lets you and your team push changes in real time. No interruptions, just progress.

If you don’t already know about [**Docker Context**](https://arc.net/l/quote/zsorhfhl), you’re missing something that can potentially improve team dynamics. It allows you to switch between different Docker daemons, such as a dedicated dev server with Docker installed. Instead of running everything on your local machine, you can offload work to a remote server and still manage containers as if they were local.

Serverize aims to mimic and enhance this experience without needing you to maintain a server, expose ports, or handle any of the setup. It’s designed for small teams that may not have dedicated DevOps expertise, simplifying the process so you can focus on development without worrying about the infrastructure.
