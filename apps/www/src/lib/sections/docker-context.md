# Docker Context

If you don’t already know about Docker Context, you’re missing something that can potentially improve team dynamics. It allows you to switch between different Docker daemons, such as a dedicated dev server with Docker installed. Instead of running everything on your local machine, you can offload work to a remote server and still manage containers as if they were local.

Serverize aims to mimic and enhance this experience without needing you to maintain a server, expose ports, or handle any of the manual setup. It’s designed for small teams that may not have dedicated DevOps expertise, simplifying the process so you can focus on development without worrying about the infrastructure.
