# Static Websites

In many situations where I wanted to test a new idea, share a project with others, create preview environment to test a feature, or even host a simple website, I found worrying too much about the setup and the infrastructure to be a barrier.

With Serverize, you can put your static website behind nginx and have it accessible to anyone with a link.
