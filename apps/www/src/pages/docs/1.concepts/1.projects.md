subtitle: 'The core building block for organizing your deployments in Serverize'
---

A project in Serverize is the primary unit for organizing your deployments. It acts as a workspace for a specific service, website, or API that you intend to deploy. Each project must have a unique name within an organization, which is incorporated into your deployment URLs.

## Project Structure

```
Organization
└── Workspaces
    └── Projects
        ├── Channels (dev, preview)
        │   └── Releases
        └── Runtime Secrets
```

- Your organization can have many projects
- Each project is completely separate from others
- Projects share organization-level settings

## Project Name

Project name should be short, descriptive and easy to remember (e.g., 'api', 'marketing')

- Only lowercase letters and hyphens allowed
- No special characters, spaces, or numbers
- Must be unique within your organization and is part of project [release](./releases.md) URL

## CLI

### Creating Projects

```sh frame=none
npx serverize projects create my-awesome-app
```

### List Projects

```sh frame=none
npx serverize projects list
```
