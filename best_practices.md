# Serverize Best Practices

## Introduction

This guide outlines best practices for using Serverize effectively. By following these recommendations, you can optimize your development workflow, improve Docker container performance, manage secrets securely, and make the most of Serverize's channels and releases features.

## Project Structure

Organizing your project effectively is crucial for maintainability and ease of use with Serverize. Here are some best practices for project structure:

1. **Use a consistent directory layout**: Keep your project files organized in a logical structure. For example:

   ```
   my-project/
   ├── src/
   ├── tests/
   ├── Dockerfile
   ├── .dockerignore
   ├── package.json
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Separate configuration from code**: Store configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) outside of your source code directory and use environment variables for sensitive information.

3. **Include a comprehensive README**: Provide clear instructions on how to set up and use your project with Serverize.

4. **Use .gitignore and .dockerignore**: Properly configure these files to exclude unnecessary files from your Git repository and Docker builds.

## Docker Optimization

Optimizing your Docker setup can lead to faster builds and more efficient containers:

1. **Use multi-stage builds**: Leverage multi-stage builds to create smaller, more secure final images. For example:

   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM node:14 AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build

   # Production stage
   FROM node:14-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci --only=production
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
   ```

2. **Minimize layer count**: Combine related commands to reduce the number of layers in your image.

3. **Use .dockerignore**: Exclude unnecessary files from your Docker context to speed up builds and reduce image size.

4. **Choose appropriate base images**: Use lightweight base images when possible, such as Alpine-based images for Node.js applications.

5. **Leverage Serverize's auto-setup feature**: For supported frameworks, use the `npx serverize setup` command to generate an optimized Dockerfile automatically.

## Secret Management

Proper secret management is crucial for maintaining security in your Serverize deployments:

1. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive information in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your application.

2. **Leverage Serverize's secrets feature**: Use the `serverize secrets` command to manage secrets securely:

   ```sh
   npx serverize secrets set MY_SECRET_KEY my-secret-value
   ```

3. **Avoid committing secrets**: Never commit sensitive information to your version control system. Use `.gitignore` to exclude files containing secrets.

4. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Implement a process for regularly updating and rotating secrets to minimize the impact of potential breaches.

## Efficient Use of Channels and Releases

Serverize's channels and releases features can help streamline your deployment process:

1. **Use channels for different environments**: Create separate channels for development, staging, and production environments:

   ```sh
   npx serverize project create-channel development
   npx serverize project create-channel staging
   npx serverize project create-channel production
   ```

2. **Implement a release strategy**: Use semantic versioning for your releases and create a consistent release process:

   ```sh
   npx serverize releases create v1.0.0 --channel production
   ```

3. **Automate deployments**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically deploy to appropriate channels based on your branching strategy.

4. **Use release notes**: Document changes, improvements, and bug fixes for each release to keep your team informed.

## Logging and Monitoring

Implement effective logging and monitoring practices to maintain visibility into your Serverize deployments:

1. **Use structured logging**: Implement a consistent logging format to make it easier to parse and analyze logs.

2. **Leverage Serverize's logs command**: Use the `serverize logs` command to access and monitor your application logs:

   ```sh
   npx serverize logs --follow
   ```

3. **Implement health checks**: Use the `healthCheck` option in your Serverize configuration to ensure your application is running correctly:

   ```javascript
   healthCheck: {
     test: "curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1",
     interval: "30s",
     timeout: "10s",
     retries: 3,
     startPeriod: "40s"
   }
   ```

4. **Set up alerts**: Configure alerts based on important metrics and log patterns to proactively address issues.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, you can maximize the benefits of using Serverize in your development workflow. Remember to regularly review and update your practices as your project evolves and as new Serverize features become available.
